# ROADMAP

## Progress Summary
- **Last Updated**: March 24, 2025
- **Core Infrastructure**: 70% complete (Configuration system, logging, testing)
- **NLP Enhancements**: 0% complete
- **Football Data Features**: 0% complete
- **User Experience**: 0% complete
- **Scalability**: 0% complete

## Next Steps
1. Fix failing tests to ensure full test coverage
2. Complete error handling (custom exceptions, retry mechanisms)
3. Add conversation timeout/expiry for memory management
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed football data

## 1. Core Infrastructure Improvements

### 1.1 Error Handling
- Implement custom exception classes for different error types
- ✅ Add proper error logging and monitoring
- Improve user-facing error messages with helpful guidance
- Add retry mechanisms for transient API failures

### 1.2 Configuration Management
- ✅ Move hardcoded values to configuration (e.g., API endpoints, model names)
- ✅ Add configuration validation at startup
- ✅ Support different environment configurations (dev, test, prod)

### 1.3 Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Implement unit tests with pytest for all components
- ✅ Add mocks for external services (Discord, Football API, LLM)
- ✅ Set up CI pipeline for automated testing
- ✅ Add test coverage reporting

## 2. Natural Language Processing Enhancements

### 2.1 Intent Detection
- Replace keyword matching with structured intent recognition
- Implement entity extraction (teams, players, competitions)
- Add context awareness for multi-turn conversations
- Support for common football-related queries and commands

### 2.2 Conversation Management
- Improve conversation history management with proper state tracking
- Add timeout/expiry for old conversations to manage memory
- Implement conversation context summarization for long interactions
- Support user preferences and personalization

### 2.3 LLM Integration
- Standardize prompt templates across different providers
- Implement prompt engineering best practices
- Add evaluation metrics for response quality
- Support streaming responses for faster user experience

## 3. Football Data Features

### 3.1 Enhanced Data Integration
- Support more football data endpoints and query types

- Implement data validation and normalization
- Support multiple seasons and historical data

### 3.2 Data Visualization
- Add charts and graphs for standings and statistics
- Support interactive embeds in Discord messages
- Implement exportable reports for match summaries
- Add team and player comparison features

## 4. User Experience Improvements

### 4.1 Command System
- Implement rich Discord slash commands
- Add autocomplete for team and competition names
- Support natural language commands through message interactions
- Implement help system with examples and guided flows

### 4.2 Personalization
- Allow users to set favorite teams and competitions
- Implement notification system for match events
- Support customization of data presentation
- Add user-specific command shortcuts

## 5. Scalability and Performance

### 5.1 API Optimization
- Implement proper rate limiting for external APIs
- Add request batching for related data
- Optimize response payload sizes
- Implement query parameter validation

### 5.2 Deployment and Operations
- Containerize application with Docker
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement database for persistent storage
- Prepare for multi-instance deployment
